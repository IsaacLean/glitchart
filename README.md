Glitch Art
======

Glitch Art is a simple C program that glitches images. This was built for FDM170A's databending project.

To use it you must pass in an image for it to glitch via the command line.

For example, if I want to glitch "filename.jpg" I would input the command:
./glitchart filename.jpg This is if I'm currently in the same directory as "glitchart" and "filename.jpg" is also located there as well.

Be careful! The program will destroy the original image that you want to glitch, so please remember to back up the original image first! Also there is a slight chance that the image may completely break the image rendering it unviewable in an image viewer. If that happens just try running the program again. That's what you get when you're dealing with glitches dood! :D
